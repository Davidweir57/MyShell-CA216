# CA216 Operating Systems: myshell

This a project for my second year module CA216 Operating Systems. As part of this project I developed my own Shell / Command Line Interpreter in the C programming language.

A breakdown of the shell's functionality and usage can be found in the manual folder or by using the "help" command in the interpreter.
